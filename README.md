# Android Malware Detection System

## Purpose
The Android Malware Detection System is a project aimed at detecting and preventing malware on Android devices. The system utilizes machine learning techniques (here, Random Forest Classifier) to analyze the behavior of Android applications and identify potential malware threats. By identifying and flagging suspicious apps, users can take appropriate actions to protect their devices and data.

## Implementation
The Android Malware Detection System is implemented as a Flask application. The app uses a static analysis techniques to evaluate the behavior of Android APKs. It leverages machine learning algorithms trained on a large dataset of known malware samples to identify potential threats. For this application, we have used Random Forest Classifier and the Drebin Dataset.

## Requirements
To run the Android Malware Detection System, some Python dependencies need to be installed:

``` cd /path/to/project ```
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Note: Make sure pip is already installed in your system.

## How to Run the App
To run the Android Malware Detection System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/harshita2216/android-malware-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned repository in your terminal.
3. Build the project to using `python -m app`.
4. Open the browser and visit the `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.


## Usage
Once the Android Malware Detection System is running on your device, you can perform the following actions:
1. Open the app upload the apk file.
2. The system will automatically scan and analyze the APK for potential malware.
3. If a high-risk APK is detected, you will be prompted with the appropriate result.

## Contributions
Contributions to the Android Malware Detection System are welcome. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, please submit them via the GitHub repository's issue tracker. Additionally, you can fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review.

## Disclaimer
The Android Malware Detection System is designed to assist in identifying potential malware threats, but it may not provide foolproof protection. It is always recommended to exercise caution while installing and using applications from untrusted sources. The developers of this system are not liable for any damages or losses caused by malware or false positives identified by the system.

## TODO

The current version of the project is a work in progress and not yet complete. Further enhancements are required to achieve optimal functionality. Specifically, the project would benefit from the integration of a robust database system to store and manage data effectively. Additionally, the implementation of advanced analysis techniques would greatly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the system in detecting and preventing malware. These future developments are crucial for improving the overall performance and reliability of the project.
